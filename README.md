# iSchool-ELearning Management System

The proposed E-Learning System for the Nueva Ecija University of Science and Technology (NEUST) aims to modernize and enhance the delivery of educational content and resources. This centralized platform will provide students, faculty, and administrators with an intuitive interface to access and manage learning materials, assessments, and communication tools. Designed with a user-friendly interface, the system will enable faculty to create and organize course materials, while students can conveniently access lectures, reading resources, and multimedia content anytime, anywhere. Features such as online assessments, automated grading, discussion forums, progress tracking, and real-time notifications will promote interactive learning and efficient academic management.

This initiative seeks to improve the quality of education by fostering flexibility, accessibility, and the integration of digital tools in learning. By reducing reliance on physical resources and streamlining administrative processes, the system will not only enhance the academic experience for students but also increase productivity among faculty members. Initially targeting undergraduate programs, the platform is designed for scalability to accommodate graduate programs and future institutional needs. Ultimately, this e-learning system represents NEUST’s commitment to academic excellence and innovation, providing a dynamic and technologically advanced learning environment for its stakeholders.
